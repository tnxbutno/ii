# About
This project is currently in development and serves only as a self-educational proposal!

The main goal of this project is to practice building an inverted index to
be used in my future projects. 

The project includes methods for breaking down the text into smaller parts, removing stop-words, converting tokens to lowercase, and reducing words to their base form (stemming).
